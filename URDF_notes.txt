****************************************

ROS2 urdf files

links: seperate components of the robot
	if two parts move independently
	if it makes sense (like removeable components)
	has a corresponding joint it is connected to
	have only one parent 
	can have many parents
	
	
joints: how links relate to each other (joined)
	determines each rotation in space
	Joint types: revolute, continues, fixed, prismatic (linear)
	
urdf
	xml declaration
	contains root tag.
	in root tags are link and joints

xacro [xml macro] (split files into multiple files and avoid repitition)
	added through command <robot xmlns: xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro">
	
	one main file representing robot
	can include other file
	included files need a robot tag
	main file should end as .urdf.xacro
******************************************

<link> tags
	<visual>
		<geometry> (overall shape/ path to 3d mesh)
		<origin> (offset for the geometry)
		<material> (color)
	<collision>: for physics collision
		<geometry> (overall shape/ path to 3d mesh)
		<origin> (offset for the geometry)
	<intertial>
		<mass>
		<origin>
		<inertia>

<joint> tags
	should contain 
		<name>: name of joint
		<type> how it moves
		<parent> 
		<child>
		<origin>
		<axis> axis of movement
		limits (upper/lower) 

xacro things
	properties: set to some value we can reference
		xacro:property:
			<xacro:property name="<name>" value="value">
			<x y="<tag-name>">
				<properties>
			<\x>
		this is now defined in scope 
	mathematical operators: perform math
		done in brackets ${} (ex. ${pi})
		uses the value item in the property tag
	macros: template for a tag
		<xacro:macro name="<name>" params="<params list>">
			anything you want to define asa function

		</xacro:macro>
